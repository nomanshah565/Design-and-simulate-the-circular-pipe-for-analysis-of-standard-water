# Design-and-simulate-the-circular-pipe-for-analysis-of-standard-water
Examine different parameters for flow around a blunt body which includes velocity and pressure distributions along with lift and drag coefficients for body and the effects of different flow parameters on the characteristics of the flow field.

Provide insights into the characteristics of the flow field, including the regions of high and low pressure, the wake structure, and the vortical patterns that form.
